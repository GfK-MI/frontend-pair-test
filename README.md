# GfK Pair Programming Technical Test

For this pair programming session you're required to extend this app to add a couple of features as well as finding and fixing existing issues with it.

It consumes **NASA's Mars Photo API**. Available here: https://api.nasa.gov/#mars-rover-photos

## Requirements

You are required to implement the following requirements.

- [ ] Add loading indicator for when Rover list is waiting for API response.
  * Currently on App load an AI request is made to get the list of Rovers to populate the 'Select Rover' options
  * While this request is loading add some indication in the UI so the user knows that the App is not ready
- [ ] Add pagination of Mission Day Photos.
  * Currently the API request for Mission Day Photos is hard coded to page 1
  * Update the previous/next page buttons to pass the page number to the API request
  * Update the page indicator to display the correct page number and total pages - 25 per page (total photos for the day is in the Manifest photos list)
  * Enable/Disable previous/next buttons
- [ ] Add support for filtering Mission Cameras based on Mission Day selected
  * Currently the list of cameras in the 'Select Camera' control is the full list for the Rover
  * Each mission day has a short list of cameras that have photos for that day - (available in the Manifest photos list)
  * Filter the available cameras to select based on the value in the 'Select Mission Day' input
- [ ] Add validation to Mission Day input to prevent user selecting invalid Mission Day.
  * Currently the user can input any numeric value to 'Select Mission Day'
  * Update the input to prevent/notify a user from selecting an invalid value. This would be a mission day (sol) where there are no photos (available in the Manifest photos list)

## Available Scripts

These scripts are generated by CRA. In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
